My Guitar Tabs

My Guitar Tabs is a website I made for myself to store my guitar music. It contains links to an external website with the actual content. The website sorts the tabs alphabetically and by title and artist. The user can create their own categories of tabs and add their desired tabs into the newly created categories. 

This website is built from scratch on the Django framework. It makes use of vanilla CSS styling and some jQuery functionality.
